# Deploy Capacity Planning

KtSaaS has been optimized around self-hosted or cheap VPS deploy environments.

Reliance on expensive cloud providers can often be a hurdle for SaaS businesses initially which are cash strapped and want to ship fast.

As of 2023 Q4, the full KtSaaS suite has been confirmed working on the following specs. Your mileage may vary, take this as the minimum recommended specs for your deploy environment.

- 4 vCPU (Shared)
- 8GB RAM
- 64GB Disk
- Ubuntu 20.04 Live Server

This page will be updated regularly to provide up-to-date guidance.

There are many options to consider if you're not self-hosting but don't want to go with a big name public cloud:

- [Digital Ocean](): $48/m
- [Linode](): $48/m
