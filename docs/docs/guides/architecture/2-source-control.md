# Source Control

Your KtSaaS licence grants you access to the `ktsaas-starter` [repo](https://github.com/getktsaas/ktsaas-starter) which contains all the boilerplate code you need to build your next SaaS business.

Use the `Use this template` button in Github to start a new repo with KtSaaS.

Alternatively, clone the `ktsaas-starter` [repo](https://github.com/getktsaas/ktsaas-starter) and copy the contents to a new repo within your organization.

## Updates

Licences include ongoing access to the `ktsaas-starter` [repo](https://github.com/getktsaas/ktsaas-starter). Any updates with new functionality or bug fixes will be pushed to that repo. 

Pull the latest and update your project with the following steps.

- Copy the `ci`, `docker`, `hotwire-kt`, and `ktsaas` repos
- Copy over the updated versions from `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Dependencies.kt`
