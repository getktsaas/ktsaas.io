# Deploy

Your application works locally, you're now ready to launch.

This guide will help you get your service deployed in a production environment on an Ubuntu VM. It assumes [necessary dependencies](/docs/guides/architecture/vm-dependencies) have been installed, permissions configured, and your project repo has been cloned to disk at `/home/<username>/<project>`.
